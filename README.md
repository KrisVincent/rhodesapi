    "Talk after Trust Increase 3": "These memories of Rhodes Island are completely different from those before. They have a sense of realism about them.

>POST: https://rhodesapi.herokuapp.com/api/rhodes/operator/:name

Add a specified operator to the database. Before adding, the api will check whether or not Gamepress has information on the specified operator and if it exists already. Created operator is returned in the response if successful.

>PUT: https://rhodesapi.herokuapp.com/api/rhodes/operator/

Update a speciifed operator to the database. In order to account for game updates, this is only callable on operator's in which the dateAdded field is a week out (which will be all since all were scraped in the same day). This may be still be too soon as most operators are untouched for months on end (at least until recent module updates).

#### /skins/

>GET: https://rhodesapi.herokuapp.com/api/rhodes/skins/e2/:name

Get the e2 artwork of the specified operator, if they have one.

Do not specify a value for these queries as they will return operator's with alter forms and modules, respectively.

### Notes
This is a personal project made to both learn how to make an API and get familiar with some TypeScript syntax. This was originally wrote in JavaScript but was converted into TypeScript.

The scraper and operator.json updater does not run on a set interval due to the sheer length of time it takes to scrape 200+ operators with built in delays. I chose to include user-based updates based on certain conditions (new operators, operator information going past a certain date) but most likely I will asynchronously update the database manually..
